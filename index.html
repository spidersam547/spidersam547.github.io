	<font face="Comic sans MS" style="color:yellow;" size="3"> Urban Sprawl is the most common type of growth within a city. It is the uncontrolled expansion of a city.
	Urban sprawl has its beginnings in the 1950s, when many Americans wanted to leave the cities and head towards the 
	suburbs. The opposite of urban sprawl is Smart Growth, which as implied, is more thought through and "Smart". </font>

	<font  face =" Comic sans MS" style="color:yellow;"> The former Soviet Socialist Republic of Romania has been experiencing unprecedented Urban sprawl within its municipal borders.
		Some reports estimate growth of up to 200% in the countries urban areas. 11,778,195 people, or 55% of the Romanian population, is living in Urban areas,
		and of that 55%, 34% living in metropolitan structures. Despite seeing large numbers of metropolitan growth, Romania classifies metropolitan areas as places
		under urban influence whose population exceeds 1,000,000. However the only city in Romaniaa with a population of at least 1,000,000 is Bucharest.
		All other towns in Romania contain 400,000 inhabitants. This means that out of the 21 towns and cities in Romania that have experienced urban sprawl
		after the fall of communism, Bucharest is the only one considered metropolitan.

	<font  face =" Comic sans MS" style="color:yellow;"> Contrary to Romania, which is experiencing growth after soviet control, Central Asia 
		experienced an unprecedented amount of growth during Soviet occupation. Of the six main countries who were under soviet rule (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Kygrzystan, and Tajikistan), 
		Uzbekistan has by far seen the greatest amount of Urban Sprawl. The largest city in the region is Tashkent in Uzbekistan. Tashkent has a population of approximatley 2,000,000 and is surrounded by a
		metropolitan area of 8 nearby cities. Other large cities include Baku in Azerbaijan, Ashgabat in Turkmenistan, Astana in Kazakhstan, Bishkek and Dushanbe 
		from Kygrzystan and Tajikistan respectivley.
